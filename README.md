# 👋 Hey, I'm Parthiban  
### Full-Stack Developer — Angular | .NET Core | SQL | Golang

I build systems that stay calm under pressure — APIs that carry millions of records,  
UIs that load fast without excuses, and platforms that survive real-world load.

I like solving the uncomfortable problems:
high-volume data pipelines, real-time communication, multi-tenant architecture,  
performance tuning, and scaling systems that can’t afford to break.

I'm currently building my next chapter in the **UAE** as a Full-Stack Engineer  
(Immediate Joiner — Angular + .NET Core + SQL).

## 🚀 What I Do
- Craft **Angular** frontends that feel clean, fast, intentional.  
- Build **.NET Core** APIs and microservices that hold steady at scale.  
- Tune **SQL queries** until they behave.  
- Shape **Golang** services for speed and real-time communication.  
- Deploy with **CI/CD**, Nginx, Azure Logging, Cloudflare.  
- Focus on clean architecture and production-ready delivery.
